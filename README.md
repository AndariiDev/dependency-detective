# dependency-detective
A CLI tool to check a list of dependencies from a file and checking for their existence in the file system.

It currently works with C files, but will eventually be file-agnostic (via cli arguments).


## Disclaimer
This is a learning project, and as such will likely have plenty of suboptimal or subpar implementations. It's only my second ever attempt at writing Rust.
